Firewall project i did in the Workshop in Information Security course.
The lab is attached (includes client, server and fw VMs)
hw3 supports only stateless inspection (a static table of rules)
hw4 supports stateful inspection as well, and handles ftp and http connections between client and server
hw5 also implements DLP system, and provides a defense against a real vulnerability found in the ReallySimpleSSL WordPress 2fa plugin, tested with metasploit
